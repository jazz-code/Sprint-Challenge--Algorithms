#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because of a single loop based on n.


b) 0(n^2) because of two loops based on n it becomes squared.


c) 0(n) is linear because of recursion

## Exercise II

Drop an egg from the middle floor of building
If egg breaks, all floors above this floor and this floor itself are elimiated
Else: the egg doesnt break and we eliminate all floors lower then this floor.
Find the middle of the floor and repeat until we find the highest floor that the egg doesnt break

O(log n) because this is a binary search it is logarithmic
